Basic Calculator in iOS8 using Swift
===================

Basic Calculator with +, -, รท, ร operation support. Go through the free [Standford CS193P course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099) videos to gain some understanding about the code and auto-layout concepts.

However the Calculator example used in the videos is different from this calculator. Calculator used in the CS193P is actually a [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) calculator which is somewhat advaned and hence needs a tad bit complicated code.

This is a very simple and basic calculator which should be helpful if you are a beginner with Swift or iOS development. Use of AutoLayout makes this work fine on all kinds of orientations and screen sizes.
